	<blockquote cite = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo">
	<p>
	The beating heart of the nation, the city is a captivating melange of varying cultures, ethnicities, and denominations. 
	Its history stretches back over 2000 years. Its ports have seen the likes of the ancient Greeks, Persians, Romans, Arabs,
	Indians and Chinese. Though rife with heritage and history, Colombo's appeal stems from it's night life. A city that lays
	dormant in the day comes alive at night; the coast which once welcomed ancient foreigners from far and wide for trade now 
	sees itself welcoming them to relish in it's nativity.
	
	The city also serves as the executive and judicial capital of the country. It is by and large the most populous city, and
	often referred to as the de facto capital, since the actual capital city of Sri Jayawardanepura Kotte lies within the
	urban area of Colombo.
