        <div id="SriLankamap"> <img src="S1_Images/sriLankamap.JPG" alt="Map of Sri Lanka">  <br> Map of SriLanka </div> <p class="HStext"> Sri Lanka has had a continuous record of human settlement for more than two millennia, and its civilization has been shaped largely by that of the Indian subcontinent. 
            The island two major ethnic groups, the Sinhalese and the Tamils, and its two dominant religions, Buddhism and Hinduism, made their way to the island from India, and Indian influence pervaded such diverse fields as art, architecture, literature, music, medicine, and astronomy.
            Despite its obvious affinities with India, Sri Lanka nevertheless developed a unique identity over the ages that ultimately set it apart from its neighbour. Cultural traits brought from India necessarily underwent independent growth and change in Sri Lanka, owing in part to the island’s physical separation from the subcontinent. 
            Buddhism, for instance, virtually disappeared from India, but it continued to flourish in Sri Lanka, particularly among the Sinhalese. Moreover, the Sinhalese language, which grew out of Indo-Aryan dialects from the mainland, eventually became indigenous solely to Sri Lanka and developed its own literary tradition.
            Also important to Sri Lankas cultural development has been its position as the nexus of important maritime trade routes between Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Long before the European discovery of an oceanic route to India in the 15th century, Sri Lanka was known to Greek, Roman, Persian, Armenian, Arab, Malay, and Chinese sailors. 
            With the coming of the Europeans, however, the strategic importance of Sri Lanka increased, and Western maritime powers fought to control its shores. Both Sri Lanka and India came under European influence and colonial rule. This common experience worked to tighten the long-standing links between the two countries, and, with the attainment of independence in the mid-20th century, 
            Sri Lankan and Indian social institutions and ideologies began to resonate more closely with each other. </p>

        <h2 class="heading2" >Prehistoric record </h2>
        
            <p class="HStext"> Geologically, Sri Lanka is an extension of peninsular India that separated from the mainland perhaps as recently as the Miocene Epoch (roughly 25 to 5 million years ago). Archaeological excavations undertaken since the late 20th century have indicated that the island already supported human inhabitants some 75,000 to 125,000 years ago. 
                The earliest occupants of the region were, like other Paleolithic peoples, hunters and gatherers who made and used fairly rough stone tools. Finer tools made of quartz and occasionally of chert become visible in the archaeological record about 28,000 years ago. The artifacts from this era, which include many microliths (very small, 
                sharp flakes of stone that can be used individually or hafted together to make a serrated edge), have been found throughout the country, especially among the grasslands of the hills and the sandy tracts of the coast. 
                By about the 9th century BCE, people had begun to experiment with food production and irrigation and had gained access to some of the iron tools produced on the continent. <br>

It can be reached from Colombo via Kurunegala -Dambulla -Anuradhapura road, or via Kandy-Dambulla- Anuradhapura road or from Puttalam along Trincomalee road. 
            The driving distance to Anuradhapura from Colombo is 206 Km and it is 138 Km from Kandy. Anuradhapura to Polonnaruwa driving distance is 101 Km.Anuradhapura was founded by a minister of King Vijaya whose name was Anuradha. King Vijaya of an Indo Aryan origin arrived in Sri Lanka on the latter part of the 6th Century BC and started the settlement by the side of Malwathu Oya (River Malwatu). 
            Anuradhapura remained as a Kingdom for almost 15 centuries and was a prominent political and trade center in South Asia during this period.It is said that the Sinhala nation has originated from the natives of the island and the Indo aryans like Vijaya and followers, who came and settled in the island from around 6th Century BC and there onwards. The native clans were called as Yakshas and Nagas.
            In the 4th century BC, King Pandukabhaya made Anuradhapura the capital of his Kingdom.Around 250 BC , King Asoka became the Emperor of India and became a Buddhist. His son and the daughter were ordained as a Bhikku and a Bhikkuni (Buddhist priest and a nun named Mahinda and Sangamitta) and became Arhat.[Mahinda is called Mihindu in Sinhalese]
            Emperor Asoka sent nine Buddhist delegations to nine countries and due to the close links with the King of Anuradhapura, Devanampiya Tissa , Emperor Asoka sent one of the deligations comprising Arhat Mahinda to Sri Lanka.
            Arahath Mihidu met the King Devanampiyatissa at a place called Mihintale Rock about 12 kM from Anuradhapura on a Poson (June) Full Moon day and embraced Buddhism after a dialogue among the two.
            Arahath Mahinda spent rest of his life in Sri Lanka and with the patronage of the King, started the Gauthama Buddha Sasanaya ( Buddhist order of the Lord Gauthama Buddha ) in Sri Lanka.
            Then started an era of culture interwoven with Buddhist philosophy that created an agricultural based society. Later Anuradhapura became a ruined city and the architectural remains can still be seen and gives a glimpse of what had been the country at that time. <br> <a class="readMore" href="https://www.srilankaview.com/anuradhapura.htm"> Read More </a> </p>

            <p class="HStext">The Ancient City of Polonnaruwa, designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982, provides an enlightening view of life in Sri Lanka's capital city from 1070 C.E. to 1310 C.E. The seat of power for the Polonnaruwa Kingdom, the king Parākramabāhu I designed and built the city utilizing techniques of irrigation and reservoirs. 
                Parākramabāhu I understood the importance of water to sustaining his kingdom, and made effective irrigation a priority. The kingdom needed the ability to withstand invasions from a succession of southern India dynasties. Powerful Indian navies and armies supported campaigns outside the India subcontinent. 
                The kings of the Anuradhapura Kingdom moved their capital inland to Polonnaruwa in the hopes of averting being taken over by invading Chola armies. The Chola Dynasty was a Tamil dynasty that ruled primarily in southern India until the thirteenth century.A great deal of the credit for establishing the Polonnaruwa kingdom, and the capital city of Polonnaruwa, 
                as a powerful dynasty goes to Parākramabāhu I. Resisting the powerful Chola dynasty required planning and organizing. For nearly 300 years, the strategy of an inland capital at Polonnaruwa worked until around 1300 C.E. when invasions from Southern India could no longer be resisted. The Sinhalese kings moved the capital to Yapahuwa and Polonnaruwa, like so many capitals in ancient India and Sri Lanka, 
                was abandoned. <br> <a class="readMore" href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Sri-Lanka/History"> Read More </a> </p>

        <h2 class="heading2"> Kandyan Kingdom </h2>
            <p class="HStext">The Central Province covers an important era in the Sri Lankan history. There is evidence that the history of the Central Province runs up to the periods lasting before the birth of The Christ. Many historians uncover the folk stories as evidence which shows that the Central Province has a long history from that of Ravana period. 
                During that period it was called Malaya Rata and from time to time tribes such as Yaksha, Raksha and Naga have inhabited in The Central Province, and mostly the Yaksha and Raksha tribes have lived in “Malaya Rata”. According to the Mahavamsa these tribes are the descendants of Pulindayin Kuweni. Inscriptions found in Bambaragala, Haragama, Doolwela, Wegiriya, Molagoda, Yanlena, Galabava and Gonawatta prove the above facts.
                During the Anuradhapura period the Central Province including the Kandy district was called by several names that refer to the upcountry, such as Malaya Deshaya, Malaya Mandalaya, Malaya Rata, and Malaynadu. During the pre-Anuradhapura era whole Sri Lanka was divided into two parts: Uththara Deshaya and Rohanaya and it can be noted that the upcountry which was also called Girimandalaya had a closer connection with the Rohanaya. 
                kandyan kingdom flagLater Sri Lanka was divided into four parts namely Rajarata, Dhakkina Deshaya, Rhohana Deshaya and Merukandara (Malaya Rata) and the central hills belonged to Merukandara or Malaya rata. The river Mahaveli divides the Malaya Deshaya as Uththara Malaya and Dakkina Malaya. In the Anuradhapura period Uththara Deshaya operated as a divisional state. Then during the period of king Parakramabhahu 1st, 
                the Uththara and Dakkina divisions were combined together and was called Malaya. king rajasinha iiDuring the 6th A.C to the 11th A.C Malaya Deshaya was ruled by a prince named Malaya Raja yet it was under the authority of the rulers of Anuradhapura and Polannaruwa.  But after the administrative centers of the country changed towards the South-West the emergence of the upcountry is visible. With the collapse of the Pollonaruwa kingdom, 
                its inhabitants started shifting toward Malaya Deshaya and it caused its population growth. Towards the 14th century, Malaya rata, which is the present central province, marked an important turning point in the Sri Lankan political history. The historians suggest that this trend is visible by the shifting of the kingdom to Gampola by king Buwanekabahu IV and later several kings establishing their kingdom in the upcountry and the bringing of the sacred Tooth relic to Gampola.  
                The specialty of the central province is that it has a natural protective structure towards enemy attacks. It provided enough protection to the kings to organize armies to attack enemies and protect the nation from invades. The birth of “Senkadagala” is marked when Senasammatha Wickramabahu chose Senkadagala as his Capital city in 1480 A.C. <br> <a class="readMore" href="http://www.cp.gov.lk/home/history-of-the-kandyan-kingdom.html"> Read More </a> </p>
        <h2 class="heading2"> Independence of Sri Lanka </h2>
        <p class="HStext"> The Sri Lankan independence movement was a peaceful political movement which was aimed at achieving independence and self-rule for the country of Sri Lanka, then British Ceylon, from the British Empire. The switch of powers was generally known as peaceful transfer of power from the British administration to Ceylon representatives, 
            a phrase that implies considerable continuity with a colonial era that lasted 400 years.[1] It was initiated around the turn of the 20th century and led mostly by the educated middle class. 
            It succeeded when, on 4 February 1948, Ceylon was granted independence as the Dominion of Ceylon. Dominion status within the British Commonwealth was retained for the next 24 years until 22 May 1972 when it became a republic and was renamed the Republic of Sri Lanka.<br> <a class="readMore" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_independence_movement#:~:text=It%20succeeded%20when%2C%20on%204,the%20Republic%20of%20Sri%20Lanka."> Read More </a> </p>
