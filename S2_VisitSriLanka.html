                <h1>Unique Cultural Heritage</h1>
                <img src="S2_Images/History.jpg" alt="History Image">
                <p>
                    The endless natural beauty of Sri Lanka lends 
                    itself well to exploration on foot. 
                    If postcard-worthy views and ancient cultural 
                    sites appeal to you, head to the Cultural Triangle. 
                    Here you can ascend to Sigiriya, an awe-inspiring palace 
                    and fortress complex set atop a rocky plateau.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We also highly recommend trekking through the brilliant 
                    hills of tea country. There’s a multitude of routes including
                     the iconic Adam’s Peak. Although the hike to reach the peak 
                     of the mountain is a challenge, the rewards are breathtakingly 
                     beautiful. We recommend starting early to avoid the heat of the 
                     day and witness the orange and pink light of sunrise as you stand
                    above the clouds.

                <h1>Tropical Climate</h1>
                <p>
                    No matter what time of year you choose to visit Sri Lanka, 
                    you will be treated to wonderful weather. In fact, this is 
                    one of the warmest countries in the world. The northern and 
                    eastern regions tend to be drier and hotter, while the central 
                    highlands see the most rainfall.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The best time to visit Sri Lanka depends on your interests.
                     For beach holidays, plan your trip from November to March; 
                     for wildlife spotting, the best season is May to October.

                <h1>Epic Train Journeys</h1>
                <img src="S2_Images/Train.png" alt="Climate Image">
                <p>
                    One of the best ways to explore Sri Lanka is by train. The 
                    country has several fantastic rail routes that will carry you 
                    through bustling cities, dense forests, deep valleys and surf 
                    towns, promising unbelievable views along the way.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you only have time for one train journey, make it the one 
                    from Colombo to Kandy. This historic route will take you from 
                    Sri Lanka’s largest and busiest city to its tranquil cultural 
                    capital, passing through tropical paddies and picturesque villages 
                    as you go.

                <h1>Huge Tea Plantations</h1>
                <p>
                    Since the first tea bush was planted here in 1867, 
                    Sri Lanka has become the world’s fourth largest producer
                    of tea. In fact, you might recognise its former name – Ceylon – 
                    as a variety of tea that’s still popular today.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sri Lanka’s tea country is a gorgeous expanse of undulating 
                    green hills and lush plantations. It’s one of the only places 
                    on earth where tea is still harvested by hand. Here you can 
                    learn about traditional methods and sample premium brews as 
                    you breathe in the fresh highland air.
